## üì± Aragon Apps

Apps you can plug into your Aragon DAO.

### üí± Tokens & Financial Stuff

- [Token manager](https://aragon.helpscoutdocs.com/article/18-token-manager) - An app that creates and manages tokens that can be used in Aragon DAOs.
- [Vault](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/vault) - A vault that can be configured to be managed by DAO token holders (requires using [Finance](https://aragon.helpscoutdocs.com/article/20-finance) app as a front-end).

- [Agent](https://aragon.org/agent) - A "smart vault" that allows the DAO to act like an externally owned account (EAO). You can send tokens directly to the Agent's contract address and Agent can do anything you can do via Metamask, however, actions are routed through a DAO vote by default (but you can change this just like with any app).

### FAQs / Gotchas

- If you're trying to add a token to something (like TokenRequest, Redemptions, etc) on Rinkeby and the client says you don't have the permissions (but you do), it might be because the token you're trying to add is deployed on Mainnet but not Rinkeby.
- If the CLI says `transaction path not found` just wait a few min and try again. Sometimes it just magically works.

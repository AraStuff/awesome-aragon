## üì± Aragon Apps

Apps you can plug into your Aragon DAO.

### üí± Tokens & Financial Stuff

- [Token manager](https://aragon.helpscoutdocs.com/article/18-token-manager) - An app that creates and manages tokens that can be used in Aragon DAOs.
- [Vault](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/vault) - A vault that can be configured to be managed by DAO token holders (requires using [Finance](https://aragon.helpscoutdocs.com/article/20-finance) app as a front-end).
- [Finance](https://aragon.helpscoutdocs.com/article/20-finance) - A front-end for the [Vault](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/vault) app.
- [Agent](https://aragon.org/agent) - A "smart vault" that allows the DAO to act like an externally owned account (EAO). You can send tokens directly to the Agent's contract address and Agent can do anything you can do via Metamask, however, actions are routed through a DAO vote by default (but you can change this just like with any app).
- [Token request](https://github.com/1Hive/token-request-app) - Request DAO tokens in exchange for other tokens (usually ETH or DAI).
- [Redemptions](https://github.com/1Hive/redemptions-app) - Redeem tokens against a basket of white-listed tokens held in the DAO.
- [Projects](https://github.com/AutarkLabs/planning-suite/tree/dev/apps/projects) - An app that allows the DAO to award bounties for working on GitHub Issues.
- [Allocations](https://github.com/AutarkLabs/planning-suite/tree/dev/apps/allocations) - Allows the DAO to set a budget of tokens to allocate on a weekly basis.
- [Rewards](https://github.com/AutarkLabs/planning-suite/tree/dev/apps/rewards) - Dividends for DAO members.
- [Payroll](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/future-apps/payroll) - Recurring payments from the DAO.

- [Dandelion voting](https://github.com/1Hive/dandelion-voting-app) - Like the reg voting app, but votes are put in a que and information on who voted on what can be connected into other Aragon apps (mainly within [the Dandelion suite](https://1hive.org/getting-started-with-dandelion-organizations/)).
- [Dot Voting](https://github.com/AutarkLabs/planning-suite/tree/dev/apps/dot-voting) - Dot voting for DAOs (only works for signalling or distribution of allocations)
- [Furarchy](https://github.com/levelkdev/futarchy-app) - Futarchy markets for governance.
- [Delay](https://github.com/1Hive/delay-app/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md) - The Delay app is a [forwarder](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/forwarding-intro). It can delay, pause, and resume an action initiated by a DAO member.
